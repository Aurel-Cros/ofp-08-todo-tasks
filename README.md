## How to use

It's super easy ! Simply head to the release link and you're ready to go ! Add a task by using the + button, then type what task you want to remember about.

Once it's done, simply click on the checkmark next to your task and it'll be marked as completed. Use the trash can button to delete it.

Everything will stay in place until your next visit off course ! (Be careful when you clear your navigation data, though...)
